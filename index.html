        <h2>Nutrition and cooking:</h2>
        <p>Bitter gourd leaves are a good source of calcium, iron, phosphorus, and vitamins A & B. Fruit contains folate, vitamin C, polypeptide-P, and vegetable insulin or charantin, which lowers blood sugar levels. Immature fruits, leaves, and young shoots are boiled, pickled, and used in soups and curries. Immature fruits can be stuffed, curried, steamed, pickled, and added as ingredients for stir- fries, stews, and soups.</p>
